Hi guys I have completed this beginner level project of task list app using React JS .
I have accomplished this beginner level project as a kickstart towards my full stack knowledge, literally MERN stack. ðŸŽ‰ 
 The app is just a simple "TASK RECORDER" app, which implements Javascript functions like arrow functions, callback function, useeffect function, it follows basic CRUD operations and error handling. It has a local Storage in JSON format. It uses json-server to connect database and the application. ðŸ¤– 
 Moreover after developing the app through self studying, I have understood the basic purpose of ReactJS and how to use it. This is my first beginner level app and I am confident about my skills. ðŸ”¥ ðŸš€ âœ¨
